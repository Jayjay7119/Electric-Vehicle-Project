# Electric-Vehicle-Project

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide a report on electric vehicles of certain brands and how some of thier aspecs differ such as acceleration, Powertrain, efficiency, and rapid charging. I have created a tableau dashboard highlighting those aspects linked [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jayden.lopez3180/viz/EVDashboard_17103865270040/Dashboard1).

### Data Sources

Electric Car Data: The primary dataset used for this is the "ElectricCarData_Clean.csv" file

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis
- Tableau - Data Visualization


### Data Cleaning/Preperation

In the initial data cleaning phase I performed the following tasks:
  1. Data Loading and Inspection
  2. Handled missing values
  3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Questions

During Data analysis I explored the EV dataset too answer these questions:
  1. Which car has the fastest 0-100 acceleration?
  2. Which has the highest efficiency?
  3. Does a difference in power train effect the range, top speed, efficiency?
  4. how does price relate to rapid charging?

### Data Analysis

During the Data Analysis phase I worked with the "ElectricCarData_Clean.csv". I removed some columns that were not needed for the report (RapidCharging, PlugType, Segments, and Seats) as well as removed some brands but stuck with the major ones (Ford,BMW,Tesla, and Audi). Another task i completed in this phase is Convert data from Kmh to MpH where needed aswell as the price from Euro to USD.
