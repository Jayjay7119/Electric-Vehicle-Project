# Electric-Vehicle-Project

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights on electric vehicles of certain brands and how some of thier aspecs differ such as acceleration, Powertrain, efficiency, and rapid charging. I have created a tableau dashboard highlighting those aspects linked [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jayden.lopez3180/viz/EVDashboard_17103865270040/Dashboard1).

### Data Sources

Electric Car Data: The primary dataset used for this is the "ElectricCarData_Clean.csv" file

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis
- Tableau - Data Visualization


### Data Cleaning/Preperation
In the initial data cleaning phase I performed the following tasks:
  1. Data Loading and Inspection
  2. Handled missing values
  3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Analysis
Data analysis involved exploring the EV dataset too answer these questions:
  1. Which car has the fastest 0-100 acceleration?
  2. Which has the highest efficiency?
  3. Does a difference in power train effect the range, top speed, efficiency?
  4. how does price relate to rapid charging?
