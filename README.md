# Electric-Vehicle-Project

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide a report on electric vehicles of certain brands and how some of thier aspecs differ such as acceleration, Powertrain, efficiency, and rapid charging. I have created a tableau dashboard highlighting those aspects linked [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jayden.lopez3180/viz/EVDashboard_17103865270040/Dashboard1).

### Data Sources

Electric Car Data: The primary dataset used for this is the "ElectricCarData_Clean.csv" file

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis
- Tableau - Data Visualization


### Data Cleaning/Preperation

In the initial data cleaning phase I performed the following tasks:
  1. Data Loading and Inspection
  2. Handled missing values
  3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Questions

During Data analysis I explored the EV dataset too answer these questions:
  1. Which car has the fastest 0-60 acceleration?
  2. Which has the highest efficiency?
  3. Does a difference in power train effect the range, top speed, efficiency?
  4. how does price relate to charging?

### Data Analysis

During the Data Analysis phase I worked with the "ElectricCarData_Clean.csv". I removed columns that were not needed for the report (RapidCharging, PlugType, Segments, and Seats) as well as removed some brands but stuck with the major ones (Ford,BMW,Tesla, and Audi). Another task i completed in this phase is Convert data from Kmh to MpH where needed aswell as the price from Euro to USD. "ElectricCarData_TabReady.xlsx" Shows the data that is ready for visualizaion.

### Key Findings (Visualized in Tableau)
In the Tableau dashboard I created you can see 4 sections for the 4 questions that needed to be answered. Also you can see out of all the different brands that were in the dataset I only displayed those i thought to be most inportant in  my case (Tesla, Ford, Audi, and BMW)
  1. Which car has the fastest 0-60 acceleration? - Out of the 4 brands and their respected models, there is a clear winner in fastest accelration and that is to Tesla's Roadster coming in at 1.25 seconds.
  2. Which has the highest efficiency? - out of the 4 brands it was a close call between Audi and Tesla but ultimately Audi takes it at 434 WhM.
  3. Does a difference in power train effect the range, top speed, efficiency? - In this bar chart there is a clear difference between AWD Eletric vehicles and RWD, notably the Range, top speed, and efficiency are better paird with the AWD powertrain excelled better then those paird with the RWD powertrain.
  4. how does price relate to charging? - In the scatterplot of the dashboard the shows that the tesla and audi have a far greater rapid charge then BMW and ford, proving that price (although may not be the min reason) does have an impact on Rapid chargins as those brands cost significantly more than BMW and Ford.
